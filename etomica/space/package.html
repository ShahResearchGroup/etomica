Specifies abstract classes and interfaces that define the nature of the physical space in which
a simulation is performed.  Implementations are given in the packages {@link etomica.space3d etomica.space3d},
{@link etomica.space2d etomica.space2d}, and {@link etomica.space1d etomica.space1d}, for 3-, 2-, and 1-dimensional
spaces, respectively.  The key elements are:
<ul>
<li>Vector, which for a D-dimensional space is a set of D fields of type double, and methods used the
perform vector operations on them.
<li>Tensor, which defines a 2nd-rank tensor in the D-dimensional space.  It hold D^2 fields of type double, and
defines methods used to perform tensor operations on them.
<li>Orientation, which provides fields and operations define and manipulated an oriented body.
<li>Coordinate, which holds one or more Vector (and perhaps Orientation) instances needed to specify
the relevant coordinates of an atom.  Coordinates may be just a position/orientation, or additionally
include momentum components.  An instance of Coordinate is held by every Atom.
<li>Boundary, which is held by a Phase instance to define the size of the space and to specify what
happens as atoms cross the boundary of the space (e.g., periodic boundaries).
</ul>

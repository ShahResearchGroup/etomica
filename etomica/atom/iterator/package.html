Provides interfaces and classes for iteration of Atoms. The {@link etomica.atom.iterator.AtomsetIterator AtomsetIterator}
defines the basic interface, and this is extended for the specific cases of iteration of Atoms and AtomPairs.
The interfaces are defined such that all iterators support both <i>external</i> and <i>internal</i> iteration.  
With external iteration the client controls the iteration, typically through a <tt>while</tt>loop construct:
<code>
iterator.reset();
while(iterator.hasNext()) {
   Atom atom = iterator.next();
   </code><i>code using atom</i><code>
}
</code><br>
With internal iteration, the iterator controls.  It is invoked by passing to the iterator an appropriate 
{@link etomica.action.AtomsetAction AtomsetAction}, which the iterator performs on each iterate:
<code>
iterator.allAtoms(action);
</code>
<p>
External iteration always requires invocation of <tt>reset</tt> before commencing iteration.  Clients should
always assume that an iterator requires resetting before use (all freshly constructed iterators require reset,
for example).  On the other hand, internal iteration my be performed without invoking reset.  Note that any
use of internal iteration will in general change the state of an external iteration, so they should not be
used concurrently.
<p>
The behavior of many of the iterators is configurable, so they can provide a different set of iterates depending
on their conditioning before iteration begins.  Repeated iterations (invoking reset in between) will yield the
same set of iterates as long as the conditioning isn't changed.  Specific ways that iterators can be conditioned
are documented with each iterator.
<p>
Several of the iterators are designed for iteration within the Atom tree (see {@link etomica.atom etomica.atom}).
These iterators usually implement <tt>AtomIteratorBasisDependent</tt>, <tt>AtomIteratorTargetable</tt>, and/or
<tt>AtomIteratorDirectable</tt>, indicating that they take specification of:
<ul>
<li>a <i>basis</i>, which is the parent Atom of the iterates; the basis defines the Atoms subject to iteration
(though other specifications may exclude some of these Atoms).
<li>a <i>target</i>, which is an atom that nominally appears in all iterates (e.g., it is one of the Atoms in every
AtomPair iterate); "nominally" is used here because the iterate may be a related Atom, such as the target's parent.
<li>a <i>direction</i>, which specifies the direction of iteration from the nominal target ("UP" or "DOWN").
</ul>
Specific behaviors when interpreting these specifications are documented with each iterator.  The <tt>IteratorDirective</tt>
class provides a portable specification of a target and direction (among other things that are infrequently used).
<p>
Most of the iterators have at their core the iteration over AtomLists, sometimes requiring iteration beginning
from a specific Atom in the list, and proceeding in one direction or the other. AtomIteratorSequence performs this
iteration, and several of the other iterators are built around it (the <tt>seq</tt> field in Atom provides direct 
access to the Atom's linker that holds it in its parent's childlist, and is often used in this context.)
<p>
Several of the AtomPair iterators (with names beginning "Api") have designations "11", "1A" and "AA".  These indicate
that the iterator provides (respectively) a single pair (each Atom 1 time); a specific Atom (1) paired with 
all (A) atoms matching some specification; or all (A) atoms formed with all (A) other atoms matching specifications
given to the iterator.
<p>
The class <tt>ApiBuilder</tt> provides static methods for constructing some useful AtomPair iterators.  It does
this by passing appropriate arguments or Atom iterators to configurable AtomPair iterators.
<p>
A comprehensive suite of JUnit tests have been developed to test the iterators.  These may be consulted as examples
for their use; {@see etomica.junit.atom.iterator}.

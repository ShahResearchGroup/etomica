Provides interfaces and classes that extend or implement the {@link etomica.Action} interface,
and perform elementary actions on simulation elements.  
Examples include classes that move an atom, or that change the density of a phase.  
Interfaces extending Action define actions for different <i>etomica</i> elements, such as
Phase, Atom, and so on.  Atomset actions are expected as arguments
to the allAtoms methods of {@link AtomIterator} and {@link AtomsetIterator}.

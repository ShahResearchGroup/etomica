 * Base class for classes that perform some elementary action on an atom.
 * These classes see use in several ways:
 * <ul>
 * <li>they can be passed to the allAtoms method of atom iterators, which then performs
 * the specified action on all the atoms of the iterator.  
 * <li>they can be used in a DisplayBox.AtomActionWrapper, to specify some action in response to 
 * selection of an atom by the mouse.  
 * <li>they may be used to generate a Monte Carlo trial in an MCMove object.
